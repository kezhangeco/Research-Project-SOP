## What is a practical computing workflow?
A standard operating procedure (SOP) for:
  
  1. Managing data: raw data &rarr; clean data &rarr; metadata
  
  2. Programming: `R` environment &rarr; eliminate duplication
  
  3. Collaborating: shared online workspace
  
  4. Organizing projects: structured folders
  
  5. Tracking work: timestamping changes &rarr; `Git`
  
  6. Manuscripts: sync changes with others &rarr; `Google Docs` 

---
## Why is a computing workflow important?

- Help you to track research changes.

- Prevent (hopefully) communication errors. 

- Improves research reproducibility, such that your collaborators (e.g., yourself in the future) can replicate the projects easily.

# Data Management

---
## Raw Data

- Save them in the original format from data collections, do not overwrite with the clean data.

- Backed up in three locations, including an external drive. 

- If the data collection process is long, back up raw data constantly from the place of the data collection.

- If the data are too large, avoid making local copies casually. You should consult the IT for remote storage.    

---
## Clean Data

*Create the data you wish to see in the world:*

- **Variable/Column names**. E.g., No to `Q1`, Yes to `Participant_ID`.

- **File names**: meaningful names, possibly include metadata. 

- **Metadata**: data explaining what the research data are about. E.g., a README file explaining variable names, recoding rules, missing values (`NA`), file names.

---
## Record all the steps of data analyses

- **For R**: steps will be recorded in your analysis scripts with comments.

- **For humans**: use a README file to record data analyses.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics('knit_pics/clean_steps.png')
```

# Programming

---
## R project with `renv`
- RStudio `New File` &rarr; `New Project` for an independent project.

- Create a project-local `R` environment using `renv`, which isolates projects' package library, so that:
  - Updating packages in Project A won't affect packages in Project B.
  - Local package versions can be recorded for reproducibility.
  
- Learn more about `renv` in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjlEbIDevOs.

---
## Coding style
- *More* short and single purpose functions, *less* big code blocks.

- Eliminate duplication. Write a function if you need to achieve the same purpose twice.

- Do not comment and uncomment code to control a program's behavior. Write a function...

- Explain what this script is about at the start and comment every functions on their purpose, inputs, outputs.

---

# Collaboration

---
## Online shared workspace 

- `GitHub/Gitlab`: share coding scripts.

- Use a project management app to track tasks. 
  - E.g., [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product/notion-for-education), [Trello](https://trello.com/en) 
  
--
  
  
  **Beware of *data privacy* on these platforms, they store info remotely on their server, not locally.**

 
---

# Project Organization

---
## Project layout 

- Put projects in independent folders.


- Folder structure:

  - **Data**: sub-folders for raw data & cleaned data.
  - **Docs**: manuscripts, lab notes, and etc.
  - **Code (R `Project`)**: 
      - 0_cleaning.Rmd
      - 1_analysis,Rmd
      - 2_functions.R
      - README.md
      - Linked to `GitHub`
  - **Results**: generated from `RMarkdown`.

# Tracking Changes

---
## Version control
- Many modifications happen in research projects, you need to create a system to keep tracking these changes. Optimally, you can retrieve a specific version of the project, and understand how and why these changes are made compared to the last version.


**You should**:

- Back up files ASAP once they created (e.g., use Time Machine constantly).

- Maintain a checklists of changes, explaining changed contents and reasoning. 

- Share changes frequently with collaborators.

---
## `Git`
- `Git`: a version control system to track changes in files in research projects (e.g., code, results).

- [`GitHub`](https://GitHub.com/): an online platform hosting `Git` projects. UBC also hosts `Git` projects via [`Gitlab`](https://gitlab.math.ubc.ca/), so you are likely to be safe to have non-public info there.



**Scenario**

- *Collaboration project*: highly recommended. `Git` tracks changes made by each contributor so that changes won't be conflicted.

- *Solo project*: useful for timestamping changes, but it's SO PAINFUL to learn for this purpose alone. But, it's a good place to start learning for future collaborations.
    - Manual alternative? Copy the entire project whenever a significant change has been made and then save it in a sub-folder with a timestamping name.

# Manuscript and The End

---
## Ready, Results!
- Prepare the results using `RMarkdown`'s `knit` function
  - `RMarkdown` render a document (e.g., PDF, PPT) of code and results. The advantage is that you no longer have "results_final.pdf", "results_final_final.pdf", because the latest script will always output a latest results. 
  
  - The `knit` function will also automatically export all graphs to the `R` working directory. 
  
- `Git` can also track changes in `RMarkdown` or markdown in general, unlike PDF or Word, so you can timestamp the results' version.

---
## Write Up
- Use online tools to synchronizing writing with collaborators.

- Recommend Google Docs because you can write together without creating conflicts.

---
## The End
- Archive data.

- Publish data with the `GitHub` repo for a reproducible project.

# A `GitHub` + `RStudio` version control workflow 

---
## Step 0: Software Installations
You can follow the wonderful [`Happy Git and GitHub for the useR`](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html) for details.

- Register an account on [`GitHub`](https://GitHub.com/) or UBC [`Gitlab`](https://gitlab.math.ubc.ca/).

- `R` and `RStudio`.

- Install [`Git`](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html).

- Install a `Git` client: `RStudio`, see [here](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html) for other options.

layout: true 

## Step 1: Linking up `GitHub` + `RStudio`
---

- A new user needs to generate a new *Personal Access Token* on [`GitHub`](https://GitHub.com/settings/tokens). The token is a credential to interact with the `GitHub` server from you local computer.

- Create a [new repo](https://GitHub.com/new) on `GitHub`.
  - Check "Add a README file".

---

- Clone the repo to your local computer and link it with a R project, so that changes in this R project can be `Git` tracked and backed up on `GitHub`.

  - `GitHub` repo, copy the HTTPS url from the green `Code` button.
  - `RStudio` &rarr; `File` &rarr; `New Project` &rarr; `Version Control` &rarr; `Git`.
  - Paste the HTTPS url into the `Repository URL`
  - Enter your `GitHub` username + Token
  - `Create Project` 
  - Linked!

---
layout: false

## Step 2: Make local changes, save, commit in `Git`

Do this every time you finish something valuable. 

- E.g., Just made some changes in the README file.

- On `RStudio` upper right panel `Git` window, check **Staged** box of the README.md.

- Click **Commit** &rarr; write a commit message &rarr; **Commit**. You just saved the changes locally, in the future, you can trace it back to this version knowing your **Commit** message.

---

## Step 2: Make local changes, save, commit in `Git` - `.gitignore`

- DO NOT commit data files for the sake of privacy and storage space, that include `R` temporary data such as `.Rhistory`. You can use [`.gitignore` files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files) to ignore specified files.

- `R project` will automatically add a `.gitignore` file, in which you can name whatever files you do not want `Git` to track. 
[Here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/R.gitignore) is a typical `.gitignore` file for `R`. 

- Read the how to `.gitignore` on `RStudio` [here](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/02-ignore/index.html). 

---
## Step 3: Push the local changes to the remote `GitHub` repo
Do this less often, your collaborators may not need to see every attempts of the analysis.

- Press the blue **Pull** button to download the changes made by your collaborators. Ignore if it's a solo project.

- Press the green **Push** button to upload the changes to `GitHub`. You will then see the changes appear on the repo webpage.

---
## Step 4: Working with the `renv` package

- Initialize an environment:
```
renv::init()
```
- After install/remove packages as needed, you can save the info about these packages in the lockfile (`renv.lock`):
```
renv::snapshot()
```
- After install/remove more packages, if you wish to revert to the library recorded in the lockfile:
```
renv::restore()
```

- The `.Rprofile`, `renv.lock` and `renv/activate.R` files should be version controlled, the `renv/library directory` can be ignored.
